    "In this report, we will try to analyze the **best location and time** for cycling activities. Specifically, this project will be targeted at stakeholders who are interested in **cycling activities** such as individual cyclists, cycling communities, and also companies / sponsors / event organizers of cycling activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a pandemic, many people choose cycling as an alternative to sports. Cycling is considered the safest way to exercise because of minimal contact with other people. There are many accidents involving cyclists. Cyclists also need protection and a sense of security while on the road. Cycling is not only interpreted as a transportation activity, but also sports and recreational activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an accident occurs, in comparison, car drivers are still protected by car frames and car safety technology. So, the chances of surviving or being injured are still quite low compared to cyclists. Cyclists are only protected by wearing helmets on their heads. When an accident occurs, their bodies, feet and hands have the potential to be injured.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will assist the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) to provide extra traffic signs in accident-prone areas for cyclists. This project will also help the [cyclist community](http://wabikes.org/growing-bicycling/resources/bike-clubs-in-washington-state/) like **Cascade Bicylcle Club, COGS (Cyclists Of Greater Seattle), Brake the Cycle, etc.** to find out the right track and time to hold a cycling event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many events are held by many cyclist communities. For example, Cascade Bicylcle Club. This club hosts **several major riding events** every year including Chilly Hilly, Seattle Bike-n-Brews, Ride for Major Taylor, Flying Wheels Summer Century, Woodinville Wine Ride, Seattle Night Ride, the Red-Bell 100, Seattle to Portland (STP), Ride from Seattle to Vancouver and Party (RSVP), Ride Around Washington (RAW), High Pass Challenge (HPC), and Kitsap Color Classic (KCC) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Bicycle_Club#Major_events)). This project can help **companies, sponsors, and event organizers** to create **safe cycling events** for all participants."
